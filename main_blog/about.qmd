Hi, I’m Bruno del Río — an AI/ML engineer passionate about building practical, scalable AI solutions.

I specialize in LLM-based applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and cloud-native architectures, with hands-on experience in Python, FastAPI, and AWS. Over the past years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from multi-agent chatbots to sales forecasting systems, bridging the gap between technical teams and business goals.

I’m also part of the AI Research Group at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, where I explore vector search, prompt engineering, and large-scale machine learning services.

This blog is where I share my learning journey — from experiments with new tools to reflections on AI projects and research.
