Today I started a new AI course with Zach Mueller:  
*"Scratch to Scale: Large-Scale Training in the Modern World"*.

The course focuses on efficient training techniques for LLMs—particularly parallelism—and how these concepts apply to broader machine learning workflows. 

I’ll be updating this post daily with what I learn and my progress along the way.

## Day 1 — September 2nd, 2025

The first day began with an introduction to the course, its contents, and what we will be covering throughout the week.

Zach introduced a Python library he developed called ```nbdistributed```, [link to Zach's repository](https://github.com/muellerzr/nbdistributed). This tool helps illustrate how parallelism works in Jupyter Notebooks, making it easier to experiment and see results in real time.

During the second half of the class, we discussed the capstone project and the role of blogging in this course. The capstone will involve training a model—such as Qwen or LLaMA—on a topic of our choice. I’m not entirely sure what direction I’ll take yet, but I’m confident an idea will come to mind soon.

To support this, Zach encouraged us to document our journey through a blog. He introduced **Quarto** as a tool for creating these posts and explained its benefits for structuring and sharing our progress.

Overall, it was a solid introduction that set the stage for the week ahead.

## Day 2 - September 3rd, 2025

Today wasn’t exactly a lesson; instead, we attended a fascinating conference with [Yuxiang Wei](https://yuxiang.cs.illinois.edu/), a PhD candidate at UIUC’s Computer Science department and part-time researcher at Meta FAIR.

Mr. Wei works on training large language models for code, applying techniques like synthetic data and reinforcement learning across pretraining, midtraining, and posttraining phases.

During the session, he answered a wide range of our questions. I have to admit—it was a bit hard to keep up with all the terminology and advanced tech he was diving into. So, I plan to review more advanced AI concepts to help me catch up with my peers.
