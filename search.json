    "text": "Hi, I’m Bruno del Río — an AI/ML engineer passionate about building practical, scalable AI solutions.\nI specialize in LLM-based applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and cloud-native architectures, with hands-on experience in Python, FastAPI, and AWS. Over the past years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from multi-agent chatbots to sales forecasting systems, bridging the gap between technical teams and business goals.\nI’m also part of the AI Research Group at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, where I explore vector search, prompt engineering, and large-scale machine learning services.\nThis blog is where I share my learning journey — from experiments with new tools to reflections on AI projects and research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneFun Fact\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one in my profile picture isn’t me — it’s Po, my dog."

I’ll drop by here now and then to keep it fresh."

    "text": "Day 1 — September 2nd, 2025\nThe first day began with an introduction to the course, its contents, and what we will be covering throughout the week.\nZach introduced a Python library he developed called nbdistributed, link to Zach’s repository. This tool helps illustrate how parallelism works in Jupyter Notebooks, making it easier to experiment and see results in real time.\nDuring the second half of the class, we discussed the capstone project and the role of blogging in this course. The capstone will involve training a model—such as Qwen or LLaMA—on a topic of our choice. I’m not entirely sure what direction I’ll take yet, but I’m confident an idea will come to mind soon.\nTo support this, Zach encouraged us to document our journey through a blog. He introduced Quarto as a tool for creating these posts and explained its benefits for structuring and sharing our progress.\nOverall, it was a solid introduction that set the stage for the week ahead."

    "text": "Day 2 - September 3rd, 2025\nToday wasn’t exactly a lesson; instead, we attended a fascinating conference with Yuxiang Wei, a PhD candidate at UIUC’s Computer Science department and part-time researcher at Meta FAIR.\nMr. Wei works on training large language models for code, applying techniques like synthetic data and reinforcement learning across pretraining, midtraining, and posttraining phases.\nDuring the session, he answered a wide range of our questions. I have to admit—it was a bit hard to keep up with all the terminology and advanced tech he was diving into. So, I plan to review more advanced AI concepts to help me catch up with my peers."
